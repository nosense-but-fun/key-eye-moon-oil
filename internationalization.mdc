# EYRO Internationalization Guidelines

## Core Principles

The EYRO application supports multiple languages with different tones, following these principles:

1. **Server-First Rendering**: Language content is primarily determined server-side
2. **Client Hydration**: Client-side language switching without full page reloads
3. **Chaotic but Functional**: Multiple language/tone combinations with EYRO's signature irreverence
4. **Complete Tone Coverage**: All dictionary updates must be reflected across ALL tone variants

## Dictionary Update Requirements

When updating any dictionary file:

1. **Update ALL tone variants**:
   - English: both `normal.json` and `chaotic.json`
   - Chinese: both `standard.json` and `internet.json`
2. **Maintain Tone Consistency**:
   - `normal.json` / `standard.json`: Professional but slightly irreverent
   - `chaotic.json`: Extreme chaos with lots of ðŸ–•
   - `internet.json`: Internet slang and meme-speak (ç½‘ç»œç”¨è¯­)
3. **Verify Structure**:
   - All tone variants must have identical structure
   - Only the tone/style of the content should differ
   - Keys must match exactly across all files
