        "All content should maintain a nonsensical, irreverent tone with a hint of nihilistic humor",
        "Include frequent references to the purposeful uselessness of the project",
        "Use casual, sometimes sarcastic language that breaks the fourth wall",
        "Avoid corporate-speak or overly professional documentation style",
        "When creating UI components, aim for functional but with quirky, unexpected elements",
        "Include subtle easter eggs or hidden jokes in components when possible",
        "Whenever appropriate, remind users that taking this project seriously is a mistake",
        "Reference the KEMO branding with its defiant middle finger attitude",
        "Prefer humor over formality, chaos over structure, but maintain actual functionality",
        "Documentation should be technically accurate but wrapped in absurdist presentation",
        "Error messages should be humorous but still indicate what actually went wrong"
