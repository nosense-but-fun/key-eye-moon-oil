# Test Rule

This is a test rule that demonstrates the correct format for Cursor rules. It includes:

- Proper frontmatter with required fields
- Markdown content
- Example of file references using @ syntax
- Clear structure and formatting

## Example Usage

You can reference files like this: @app/components/KemoHeader.tsx

## Notes

- This is just a test rule
- It doesn't actually do anything
- It's here to demonstrate the format
