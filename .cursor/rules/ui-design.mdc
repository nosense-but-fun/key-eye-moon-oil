# UI Design Rules for KEMO Collection

## Project Vibe

This is a chaotic playground of random pages and tools that make absolutely no sense when viewed together. The UI should reflect this spirit of controlled chaos.

## Design Principles

1. **Embrace the Absurd**
   - Use unexpected animations and transitions
   - Add random quotes and messages that make users question their life choices
   - Include hidden easter eggs and pointless interactions

2. **Visual Chaos**
   - Mix different design styles intentionally
   - Use contrasting colors and patterns
   - Break conventional UI patterns for the sake of confusion

3. **Useless Features**
   - Add buttons that do nothing
   - Include loading animations that never end
   - Create "features" that actively make the experience worse

4. **Corporate Nonsense**
   - Use excessive corporate buzzwords
   - Add meaningless progress bars and loading states
   - Include fake error messages and warnings

## Implementation Guidelines

- Keep the code as messy as the design
- Add random console.log messages
- Include unnecessary state management
- Use complex animations for simple interactions
- Add "features" that serve no purpose

## Examples

```tsx
// Good: Useless loading state
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);
useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setInterval(() => {
    setIsLoading((prev) => !prev);
  }, 1000);
  return () => clearInterval(timer);
}, []);

// Good: Pointless animation
const [rotation, setRotation] = useState(0);
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    setRotation((prev) => (prev + 1) % 360);
  }, 50);
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, []);

// Good: Random error messages
const errorMessages = [
  "Your code is too clean, try making it worse",
  "This feature was intentionally broken",
  "Error: Too much sense detected",
  "Warning: Your UI is too conventional",
];
```

## Remember

- If it makes sense, you're doing it wrong
- The more pointless the feature, the better
- Embrace the chaos, reject the order
- Make users question why they're using this
