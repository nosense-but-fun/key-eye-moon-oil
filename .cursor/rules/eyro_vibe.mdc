# EYRO Vibe Guidelines

## Core Principles

The EYRO collection embraces chaos, nonsense, and irreverent humor while maintaining actual functionality. These guidelines ensure we stay true to our anti-establishment roots.

## Content Rules

1. **Tone & Voice**
   - Maintain a nonsensical, irreverent tone with nihilistic humor
   - Use casual, sarcastic language that breaks the fourth wall
   - Avoid corporate-speak or overly professional documentation style
   - Prefer humor over formality, chaos over structure

2. **UI Components**
   - Create functional components with quirky, unexpected elements
   - Include subtle easter eggs and hidden jokes
   - Reference the EYRO branding with its defiant middle finger attitude
   - Make features that work but question their own existence

3. **Documentation & Messages**
   - Write technically accurate docs wrapped in absurdist presentation
   - Create error messages that are humorous but informative
   - Frequently reference the purposeful uselessness of the project
   - Remind users that taking this project seriously is a mistake

## Implementation Examples

```tsx
// Good: Error message that's both helpful and on-brand
function handleError(error: Error) {
  console.log("ðŸ–• Oops, something broke (as intended):", error.message);
  return "Task failed successfully! Error: " + error.message;
}

// Good: Documentation comment
/**
 * A completely unnecessary function that does something simple in the most 
 * complicated way possible. Why? Because EYRO, that's why.
 * 
 * @param {string} input - Your hopes and dreams
 * @returns {string} Crushed hopes and dreams
 */
```

## Remember

- Taking this project seriously is your first mistake
- Functionality should exist beneath the chaos
- When in doubt, add a middle finger emoji
- Keep it weird, keep it EYRO
