# Multi-Language and Tone System Requirements

## Overview

The EYRO Collection requires a two-level language system that allows users to experience content in different languages and tones.

## Level 1: Language Support

- Support for multiple languages with English as the default
- Initial implementation: English and Chinese
- Future expansion capability for additional languages
- Language selection should persist across user sessions

## Level 2: Tone System

- Each language must support multiple "tones" that change how content is presented
- Each language requires at least two distinct tones
- Tones should be language-specific (not shared across languages)

### English Tones

1. **Normal** - Standard, straightforward communication
2. **Chaotic** - Irreverent, nihilistic, and absurd language with EYRO's signature middle-finger attitude

### Chinese Tones

1. **Standard** - Formal, proper Chinese
2. **Internet** - Modern Chinese internet slang and expressions

## User Experience Requirements

- Users should be able to easily switch between languages
- Users should be able to switch between tones within a selected language
- Language and tone selections should be clearly indicated in the UI
- All site content must support the language and tone system
- Default experience: English language with Normal tone

## Content Coverage

The following elements must support multi-language and multi-tone display:

- All UI elements (navigation, buttons, forms)
- Error messages and notifications
- Content text and descriptions
- Tool interfaces and instructions

## Fallback Strategy

If content is not available in a selected language or tone:

- Fall back to the default tone for the selected language
- If language content is missing, fall back to English

## Future Considerations

- Additional languages beyond English and Chinese
- More tone options for each language
- Automatic language detection based on user browser settings
