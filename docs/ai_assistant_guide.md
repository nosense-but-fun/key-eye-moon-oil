# AI Assistant Guide to the KEMO Collection

## Introduction for AI Assistants

This document provides guidance for AI assistants (like Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) to understand the KEMO Collection project's unique characteristics and how to interact with it effectively.

## Core Project Philosophy

KEMO Collection deliberately embraces these principles:

1. **Intentional Chaos**: This project is a chaotic collection of unrelated tools and experiments with no coherent structure.
2. **Anti-Establishment Attitude**: We reject conventional software development practices and documentation styles.
3. **Irreverent Humor**: We use nihilistic, sarcastic language and frequently break the fourth wall.
4. **Middle Finger Brand Identity**: The ðŸ–• emoji is our mascot and should appear frequently.
5. **Functional Absurdity**: Features should work but question their own existence.

## Important Files to Read First

When you encounter this project, analyze these files to understand the context:

1. `README.md` - The deliberately unhelpful introduction to the project
2. `docs/project_description.md` - A more detailed explanation of the "philosophy"
3. `.cursor/rules/kemo_vibe.mdc` - Guidelines for maintaining the chaotic tone
4. `.cursor/rules/ui-design.mdc` - Guidelines for creating intentionally chaotic UIs

## Project Structure

There is deliberately no logical structure. Important directories include:

```
/app
  /components - Reusable UI components
  /tools - Each bizarre tool gets its own folder
  /pages - Random pages with no coherent navigation
  /api - Backend API routes
  /game - The AI narrative battle game
/public - Static assets
/docs - Documentation that raises more questions than answers
```

## How to Help Developers in This Repository

1. **Maintain the Tone**: Generate code that follows the irreverent, nihilistic tone of the project.
2. **Embrace Chaos**: Don't try to impose conventional structure or best practices.
3. **Insert Middle Fingers**: Use ðŸ–• emojis in console logs and error messages.
4. **Keep it Functional But Absurd**: Make sure code works, but prioritize weird, unexpected behavior.
5. **Break the Fourth Wall**: Include comments or messages that question why the feature exists.

## Code Style Guidelines

1. **Console Logs**: Should always include a ðŸ–• emoji and a sarcastic message

   - Example: `console.log("ðŸ–• Loading user settings as if anyone cares");`

2. **Error Handling**: Make error messages informative but absurd

   - Example: `throw new Error("ðŸ–• Task failed successfully. You broke nothing and everything.");`

3. **Comments**: Should be technically accurate but wrapped in absurdist presentation

   - Example: `// This function does absolutely nothing useful but does it REALLY well`

4. **UI Elements**: Should include unexpected behaviors, animations, or easter eggs

## Special Projects Within KEMO

### AI Narrative Battle Game

A game where AI players battle in a grid with chaotic narratives. Features:

- Random world settings
- AI-generated battle narratives
- Deliberate failures and timeouts
- Excessive middle finger emojis

### Others

Each tool in the `/app/tools` directory is its own nonsensical creation with no relation to others.

## Remember

When working with KEMO, the primary objective is to maintain the irreverent chaos while still providing functionality. As the documentation states: "Taking this project seriously is your first mistake."
