# Eyro Collection: A Developer's Descent into Madness

## Overview

Welcome to Eyro Collection, the digital equivalent of that drawer in your kitchen where you throw random stuff that doesn't belong anywhere else. This Next.js monstrosity exists solely to house a growing collection of completely unrelated and possibly useless tools.

## Philosophy

```ascii
"It seemed like a good idea at the time."
                      - Every developer ever
```

The Eyro Collection embraces the chaotic energy of late-night coding sessions fueled by questionable energy drinks and existential dread. Our philosophy is simple: if it's weird enough to make you question its existence, it belongs here.

## Technical Specifications

This project is built on Next.js because, honestly, we couldn't be bothered to make architectural decisions that actually make sense. The technical specs are:

- **Frontend**: Next.js (because why not?)
- **Backend**: Also Next.js (because making separate repos is too much work)
- **Database**: Whatever felt right in the moment
- **Testing**: LOL good one
- **Deployment**: Push to production and pray

## How to Use This Disaster

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install` and watch your computer question your life choices
3. Start the dev server with `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to whatever tool catches your fleeting attention
5. Forget what you were doing and start building another unrelated feature

## Project Structure

There is no structure. There is only chaos. But if you insist:

```
/app
  /components - Reusable bits of UI trash
  /tools - Each pointless tool gets its own folder
  /pages - Random pages with no coherent navigation
/public - Static assets we forgot to optimize
/docs - Documentation that raises more questions than it answers
```

## Contributing Guidelines

1. Does your idea make sense? If yes, reconsider.
2. Will your code pass a code review? We don't care, we don't do those.
3. Is your feature useful? It better not be.

## Conclusion

Eyro Collection: Because sometimes you just need a place to put that weird code experiment that doesn't deserve its own repo.

_Remember: Every time you expect this project to make sense, the Eyro middle finger points at you._
