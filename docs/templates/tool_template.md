# [Tool Name]: Yet Another Useless Addition

## What Does This Thing Do?

This tool supposedly [brief description of actual functionality], but mostly it exists to [something ridiculous]. Use it when you're [humorous situation] or when [another humorous situation].

## Features

- Actually does [real feature]
- Pretends to do [joke feature]
- Will occasionally [something absurd]
- Has a UI that [something about the intentionally weird design]

## How to Use This Monstrosity

1. Navigate to `/tools/[tool-route]` (if you can find it)
2. Enter some data that we'll probably store insecurely
3. Click buttons until something happens
4. Wonder why you're wasting your time with this

## Technical Details (for the masochists)

```typescript
// This is how the main component looks
// Don't worry, it makes even less sense in context
function UselessComponent() {
  const [state, setState] = useState("confused");

  useEffect(() => {
    // This effect runs whenever the user blinks
    return () => console.log("Goodbye, sanity!");
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="why-does-this-exist">
      {/* Insert questionable UI choices here */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Known "Features" (not bugs, never bugs)

- Sometimes it [actual issue but described humorously]
- If you click too fast, it [another actual issue]
- The UI breaks when [real edge case], but that's by design (we swear)

## Why Did We Make This?

Great question! We ask ourselves that every day. The leading theories are:

1. Someone lost a bet
2. It seemed like a good idea at 3 AM
3. We needed another useless tool for the Eyro Collection
