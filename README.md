## What is this?

This is a totally nonsensical repo, don't expect anything meaningful here.
Seriously, this is just a chaotic playground of random pages and tools that
make absolutely no sense when viewed together.

## Features

- Stuff that doesn't work
- Things that shouldn't exist
- Code written during caffeine-induced hallucinations
- UI designed by a blindfolded monkey with a crayon
- Zero practical value guaranteed

## Why?

Why not? Sometimes the best projects are the ones with no purpose.
Consider this digital equivalent of abstract art - if you think you understand it,
you're probably wrong.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev
# then question your life choices
```

## Contributing

Don't. Or do. Whatever. It's not like it matters anyway.
